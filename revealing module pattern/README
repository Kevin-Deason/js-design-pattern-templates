#Revealing Module Pattern

Javascript does not have the typical 'private' and 'public' specifiers of more traditional object oriented languages like C# or Java. However, you can achieve the same effect through the clever application of Javascript's function-level scoping. The Revealing Module pattern is a design pattern for Javascript applications that elegantly solves this problem.

The central principle of the Revealing Module pattern is that all functionality and variables should be hidden unless deliberately exposed.

###To use the module:
```js
window.revealingModule.doSomething();
window.revealingModule.init();
window.revealingModule.doSomething();
```

####Output:
```
doSomething function called
Call init method first
value in _store.someThing:

init function called

doSomething function called
value in _store.someThing:  value of something
```
